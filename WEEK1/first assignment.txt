difference between relative path and an absolute path

A relative path describes the location of a file relative to the current (working) directory.
An absolute path describes the location from the root directory

example
relative path:
.\Downloads\_MVhERr7SV6CoY7-Ho_hGw_8facf0ef2ecd4cb58588f987268fc9e1_C7M2L1-Item-4---Start-project

absolute path:
C:\Users\olawilliams\Downloads\_MVhERr7SV6CoY7-Ho_hGw_8facf0ef2ecd4cb58588f987268fc9e1_C7M2L1-Item-4---Start-project
